\item \points{3b} Implement your approach by completing the
\texttt{initial\_state}, \texttt{predict}, and \texttt{update\_state} methods
of \texttt{src-perceptron/submission.py}.


We provide two kernels, a dot-product kernel and a
radial basis function (RBF) kernel. 

Run \texttt{src-perceptron/submission.py} to train
kernelized perceptrons on \texttt{src-perceptron/train.csv}. The code will then test
the perceptron on \texttt{src-perceptron/test.csv} and save the resulting
predictions in the \texttt{src-perceptron} folder. Plots will also be saved in
\texttt{src-perceptron}.

The output plot should look similar to the following (no plot submission is required):
