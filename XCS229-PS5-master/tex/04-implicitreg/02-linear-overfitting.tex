\item \points{4b} We still work with the setup of part (a). Among the infinitely many optimal solutions of Eq.~\eqref{equ:mse}, we consider the \textit{minimum norm} solution. Let $\rho=X^\top (X X^\top)^{-1}\vec{y}$. In the setting of (a), \textbf{prove that} for any $\beta$ such that $J(\beta)=0$, $\|\rho\|_2\le \|\beta\|_2.$ In other words, $\rho$ is the minimum norm solution.

\emph{Hint:} As a intermediate step, you can prove that for any $\beta$ in the form of Eq.~\eqref{equ:ir2}, $$\|\beta\|_2^2=\|\rho\|_2^2+\|\zeta\|_2^2.$$
