\item\points{1a} \textbf{Nonnegativity.}

Prove the following:
$$\forall P, Q. \quad \KL(P\mid \mid Q) \geq 0$$

and

\[
\KL(P\mid \mid Q) = 0 \quad\quad\text{ if and only if }\quad\quad P=Q.
\]

[Hint: You may use the following result, called {\bf Jensen's inequality}.  If $f$ is a convex function, and $X$ is a random variable, then $E[f(X)] \geq f(E[X])$. Moreover, if $f$ is strictly convex ($f$ is convex if its Hessian satisfies $H \geq 0$; it is \emph{strictly} convex if $H > 0$; for instance $f(x) = -\log x$ is strictly convex), then $E[f(X)] = f(E[X])$ implies that $X=E[X]$ with probability 1; i.e., $X$ is actually a constant.]
