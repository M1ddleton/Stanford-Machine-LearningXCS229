\item {\bf Linear regression: linear in what?}

In the first two lectures, you have seen how to fit a linear function of the data for the regression problem.  In this question, we will see how linear regression can be used to fit non-linear functions of the data using feature maps. We will also explore some of its limitations, for which future lectures will discuss fixes.
