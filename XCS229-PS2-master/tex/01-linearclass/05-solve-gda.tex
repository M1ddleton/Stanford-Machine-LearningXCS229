In \texttt{src-linear/submission/gda.py}, fill in the code to calculate $\phi$, $\mu_{0}$, $\mu_{1}$, and $\Sigma$, use these parameters to derive $\theta$, and use the resulting GDA model to make predictions on the validation set. More specifically, you complete the |fit| and |predict| functions for the |GDA| class.

Make sure to write your model's predictions on the validation set to the file specified in the code. 

To verify a correct implementation, run the autograder test case |1e-4-basic| to create a plot of the \textbf{validation data} with $x_1$ on the horizontal axis and $x_2$ on the vertical axis. To visualize the two classes, use a different symbol for examples $x^{(i)}$ with $y^{(i)} = 0$ than for those with $y^{(i)} = 1$. On the same figure, plot the decision boundary found by GDA (i.e, line corresponding to $p(y\vert x) = 0.5$).\\

The output plot should look similar to the following (no plot submission is required):
